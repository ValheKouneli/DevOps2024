Used tool: ChatGPT-4o free version

# How I used it:

I asked ChatGPT to write be a Go server that respons to a GET
request with the specified information (from exercice 1). I made ChatGPT re-do my
node-server that I wrote myself, using libraries that I picked
myself. I fixed and edited the Node server made by ChatGPT myself.

In the final exercice, I used ChatGPT to give me example templates for nginx,
and I asked it how a container could be stopped from within the container.
I also made it suggest ideas on how to be able to use environment variables
in a nginx conf file.



# Motivation:

## In the first part of the exercice:

I did not have a lot of time to spend for this excercise, for example,
I did not have time to learn how to write a web server in some other language
than Node/JavaScript/TypeScript. I spent relatively long trying to create
a python web server, but I wasn't able to make it work in a container,
although it worked otherwise.

The learning goals of this excerice did not include how to write
a webserver or learning a new language, so I felt the use of LLM was
justified. After I had used ChatGPT to create the Go server, I wanted to
make my node server to match in style and neatness.

I had never used ChatGPT before to write code, and I was interested
in learning how it could be used to get started with a project.
ChatGPT is predicted to be widely used in web development in the future,
and I though it's a good idea to get to know how it can be used.


## In the final part of the exercice:

I had learned that ChatGPT is a handy tool when facing some kind of
road block, or being unable to stop a bug in the code. I knew it could
give be good suggestions without stopping me from learning the essential
stuff. I also liked how it could be used as a preliminary search engine,
meaning I could google search whatever it suggested to me.



# How it helped:

ChatGPT made be able to focus on the primary learning goals of the excercise.
Sometimes it was faster to find information using it than using google.
It helped me with some syntax issues and to figure out why something did not
work by giving me ideas about where the problem might lie.


# What kind of mistakes the LLM did:

When writing the node server, GhatGPT's server's response to GET was not
formatted correctly, as the output was all in one line. I used my own original code
to fix it. ChatGPT also didn't use the correct name for a library function
from the library I told it to use. ChatGPT was not able to correct the mistake
with formatting even when requested. ChatGPT wasn't able to keep the output format
consistent between the two servers, when I wanted the two servers return the same
information.

When asking it about specific problems, it many times hallucinated solutions that
would not work. It also sometimes forgot the context. However, it always gave some
knew ideas on what to try or what to google next.

It did not always take into account all circumstances, and it sometimes
misunderstood what it was asked to do.
