Used tool: ChatGPT-4o free version

How I used it:
I asked ChatGPT to write be a Go server that respons to a GET
request with the specified information. I made ChatGPT re-do my
node-server that I wrote myself, using libraries that I picked
myself.

Motivation:
I only knew how to write a web server in JavaScript
beforehand, and I didn't have the time to learning how
to do it in some other language. I spent a lot of time trying to
write a server in Python, but wasn't able to make it work in a container.
The learning goals of this excerice did not include how to write
a webserver or learning a new language, so I felt the use of LLM was
justified. Once I had used ChatGPT to create the Go server, I wanted to
make my node server equally neat. I had never used ChatGPT before to
write code, and I was interested in learning how it could be used to
get started with a project.

How it helped:
ChatGPT made be able to focus on the primary learning goals of the excercise.

What kind of mistakes the LLM did:
When writing the node server, GhatGPT's server's response to GET was not
formatted correctly, as it was all in one line. I used my own original code
to fix it. ChatGPT also didn't use the correct name for a library function
from the library I told it to use. ChatGPT was not able to correct the mistake
with formatting even when requested.
