ps aux

I know from other sources that the container is isolated from other processes 
running on the host, unless specifically given some visibility to them.
The fact that the ps aux command does not show any other processes demonstrates this.

uptime

I am not sure what to deduce from the fact that the uptime can be seen from within
the container. This makes sense to me, as the container is using the host kernel
(in a limited way by default).

IP address

The two servers have different IP addresses from each other and the host.
They have the same network address (the first part) but different host addresses.

df

The root partition is mounted differently inside the container and
on the host. The containers do not see the boot partition of the host.

Other notes, based on findinf, previous knowledge/experience and googling:

Containers use the host computers CPU and kernel and memory.
Memory usage can be limited.
If allowed, they can access the files in the filesystem on the host.
Containers can use the networking capabilities of the host.
Host acts as a network router to the containers. By default, the containers
on the same host are in the same brigde network, but they can be separated.
